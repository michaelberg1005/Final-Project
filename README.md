# Final-Project
Team Project on predicting election results - Michael Berg, Evan Goodwin, Brian Riordan & Ho Kuan Ivy Leong.
## Selected Topic
For our topic of analysis we decided to look at election datasets for Congress to see how predictive dollars spent, incumbent, challenger and other data tiems were in determining the winner of a number of types of elections
## Reason why we selected the topic
We were all interested to see factors that could deliver victories in elections, especially given the significance of the upcoming elections in November. Also, we liked that the data set had a clear categorical dependent variable, which made the analysis clearer. And hopefully we can use the model as a feature to predict future senate and other local governmental races. 
## Questions we hope to answer with the data
The primary questions we hope to answer are: 1.) how predictive is money spent on election results? 2.) how the term of service affects the election results? 3)how predictive is an incumbent or challenger on winning or losing an election? 4) Is there any difference between funding source for the election results? 5)how the money spent affects the election results? Depending on what further data we could find, we would also like to find out if it varies by political parties, voting options, district, state, population size, races, sex ratio, household median income and housing.
### Description of communication protocols
1.) Open communication on slack chat first and foremost to always keep up to date on what each person is doing, task, timelines and what's left.
2.) A semi-formal meet up once a day (even if for just 10 minutes) to formally fiscuss updates on each persons taks, assigning roles, or simply figuring out questions together as a group.
3.) Submit all work throug hour group GitHub, and assing one team member to review each others work. Then prior to submitting, each person has a direct line of contact with who they are in charge of reviewing.
4.) If we agree on slack that we are lost or need some sort of assistance, one (or all members) of the team will make time for an additional 10 minute zoom, or phone call as needed to resolve an issue where we are stuck.
# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
ERD, PostgreSQL and excel are used to perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using python, Jupiter notebook, and libraires such as PySpark and BeautifulSoup to assit in the ETL process.
## Database Storage
We will use Mongo for data storage. 
## Dashboard
We will use excel/tabular, JavaScript and html to create graphs and an interactive dashboard.
